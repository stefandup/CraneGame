# Crane Game Log File Data Descriptor

## File Format
- **Format**: Excel (.xlsx)
- **Location**: `logs/` directory
- **Naming Pattern**: `YYYYMMDDHHMM_TEST_CraneOut.xlsx`

## Data Structure

### Overview
The log file contains behavioral trial data from crane game experiment for *one individual subject*. Each row represents a single trial event or measurement.

### Key Columns

#### Trial Identification
- **TrialNr** (integer): Trial number identifier, ranging from 1 through 12
  - Each trial represents a distinct behavioral trial in the experiment
  - Trials are numbered sequentially

#### Temporal Data
- **Time** (float, seconds): Start time of the trial event
  - Measured in seconds from experiment start
  - Used to calculate trial duration and inter-trial intervals
  - Can be converted to minutes by dividing by 60

#### Trial Characteristics
- **BlockType** (string/categorical): Type or category of the trial block
  - Describes the experimental condition or block configuration for each trial
- **TrialType** (string/categorical): Classification of trial type (e.g., "Slip", "Non-Slip")
  - Used to distinguish between slip trials and non-slip trials

#### Slip Count Columns
The following column names are **constant** and should be used for slip analysis:
- **NrErrorSlips** (integer): Count of error-related slips
- **NrSlips** (integer): Total count of slips
- **NrOtherSlips** (integer): Count of other types of slips
- **NrNoReasonSlips** (integer): Count of slips with no reason recorded
- **NrForcedSlips** (integer): Count of forced slips

**Note**: All slip-related columns contain "slip" in their name (case-insensitive) and should be summed together when calculating total slips per trial type.

### Data Characteristics

#### Temporal Analysis
- **Total Duration**: Maximum `Time` value represents total experiment duration
- **Inter-trial Intervals**: Time differences between consecutive rows (calculated via `df['Time'].diff()`)
  - Useful for analyzing pacing and timing between trial events

#### Data Quality
- May contain empty/null values (check with `df.isnull().sum()`)
- Column names may require cleaning (leading/trailing spaces, special characters)

### Usage Notes
- **Column names are constant** across all log files. Slip-related columns (NrErrorSlips, NrSlips, NrOtherSlips, NrNoReasonSlips, NrForcedSlips) and trial classification columns (TrialType, BlockType) maintain consistent naming.
- When importing, clean column names to handle whitespace and special characters
- Time values are in seconds; convert to minutes for human-readable display
- Each row typically represents one trial event, with 12 trials per experiment session
